          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Hello! I’m Jacob and I’d like to welcome you to my report on my time
            as a student backend software engineer at Manulife Financial
            Corporation. I had a great time at Manulife and would like to share
            some of the things I learned!
          </p>
          <h3>Information about the employer</h3>
          <p>
            During the fall 2020 season, I was working for Manulife Financial on
            a co-op term. I was working remotely from my home, but had it not
            been for the pandemic currently going on I would have been working
            out of their beautiful Waterloo office. Manulife is a Canadian
            company and primarily operates as multinational insurance company,
            but they also provide other financial services such as banking.
            Founded as the Manufacturers insurance company in 1887, its first
            president was the first prime minister of Canada, John A Macdonald!
            More recently, Manulife has been going through a technological
            revolution. Moving away from mainframe based systems in favour of
            cloud based systems with Microsoft Azure to benefit from cost
            savings, scalability, and many others.
          </p>
          <h3>Job Description</h3>
          <p>
            For the duration of my co-op at Manulife, I was working with the
            Sparck squad. Sparck’s main objective at the time was assisting with
            the move to cloud-based systems to replace Manulife’s old
            mainframe-based systems. My squad’s specific focus was on creating
            and maintaining backend microservices with .Net core. The main
            project I was given to work on was a .Net framework microservice
            that’s future job would be to handle insurance claims submitted by
            dentists on behalf of patients. It was in an unfinished state and in
            need of some repairs, so I undertook some work to overhaul it. Some
            examples of the work I managed to do on it are that I migrated the
            codebase from the windows only .net framework to the latest version
            of the cross platform .net core, I fixed the code quality issues
            reported by the static code analyzer SonarQube, and I refactored the
            codebase to properly take advantage of modern .Net core features
            like constructor-based dependency injection and asynchronous
            programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            When not working on the dental claims project, I would be helping
            the team with whatever they needed. For example, I often found
            myself managing Jenkins pipelines and helping to debug them if they
            happened to fail. Another task I often picked up was writing unit
            tests or resolving code quality issues on projects being worked on
            by other team members. While most of the work I did during my work
            term was writing code, I also picked up a few tasks to write
            documentation. I would be tasked to write documents detailing the
            current status of an application or getting started documents to
            help onboard others to start working on an application. I appreciate
            that I had the opportunity to try different things at work every
            day, so I was able to find out what I most liked doing.
          </p>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            I believe that goals are a necessary tool to track and measure your
            improvements at anything, so to develop my career skills I set three
            goals for myself to work at during my co-op at Manulife.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first goal I set for myself was to improve my oral communication
            abilities. I understand that good communication skills in a work
            environment are essential, so I set this goal for myself in order to
            ensure that I can speak clearly, concisely and confidently. Since
            most of my speaking was about what work I had been doing and what
            work I plan on doing, I found that staying organized and keeping
            notes tracking what I’ve done and what my plans are helped me
            greatly in making progress towards this goal.
          </p>
          <p>
            My next goal had to do with becoming more familiar with the
            technology used by my squad. Sparck’s language of choice was C# on
            the .Net core platform, and I realized that to be truly helpful to
            my team I needed to have a thorough understanding of C# and it’s
            best practices to be able to write code independently without my
            team questioning its quality. Reflecting on this goal, I believe
            that what helped me achieve it was taking my time to fully examine
            code and not being afraid to ask questions about why the code was
            written the way it was.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final goal was wanting to learn more about the process of writing
            software to be used in an enterprise production environment. This
            means things like learning how to write code to be secure,
            performant, fault tolerant, and testable, things that can often take
            a backseat in school or personal projects. I also wanted to learn
            about the infrastructure used to support production code, like CI
            and CD systems, monitoring systems like new relic, and disaster
            recovery methods. To accomplish this last goal, I found that I
            needed to be exposed to the development and maintenance of Sparck’s
            microservices, and to pay attention to how they worked. I was able
            to see how new enterprise level applications are built with a focus
            on performance, such as considering and optimizing what lies on a
            service’s hot path. Being exposed to this kind of development taught
            me that stability is often more important than using the latest and
            greatest features. For example, choosing to use an older, LTS
            release of something than using the brand-new release may be a
            smarter choice for software that needs to have 100% uptime and
            support many users.
          </p>
          <h3>Technologies</h3>
          <p>
            Working at Manulife gave me the opportunity to use some great tools
            to assist development and remove some of the unproductive tedious
            work. Two notable examples were CI/CD pipeline systems and utilizing
            an IDE to write code efficiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            The CI/CD system used at Manulife is called Jenkins, and it’s a very
            useful tool! What a CI/CD system allows you to do is automate the
            continuous integration (validating and checking in small changes to
            SCM) and deployment of your code. I learned the process of setting
            up a new Jenkins CI pipeline to build, test, and quality check your
            code with SonarQube, as well as create CD pipelines to deploy code
            to a predefined environment, if it passed the CI checks. I learned
            that while these pipelines may take a little while to initially
            learn and setup, the payoff is worth the time investment as they
            save a significant amount of time over the long run and inevitably
            reduce the number of mistakes made by user error.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for the IDE, Sparck used Microsoft Visual Studio. After the
            initial learning curve that came from my transition from Visual
            Studio Code which I had relied on up until this point, I quickly
            realized Visual Studio is an awesome tool that makes the development
            experience much simpler by including multiple useful tools. Some of
            the many different tools it bundles together are a nice GUI for
            source control, integrated build tools that call the compiler and
            provide hooks to run batch files before and after builds, automated
            code cleanup and format tools, and an automated test runner. It also
            has extensive plugin support, so if there I was some functionality I
            needed I could download a plugin or make my own to add that
            functionality in. With the tools it provides, and some fancy editor
            features like intellisense and code generation, Visual Studio helped
            me become as productive a developer as I could be.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            My backend software engineer co-op at Manulife was a fun and
            productive time. I was happy to be a member the Sparck squad and
            enjoyed the challenging work I was doing. I was able to develop my
            programming skills as well as my communication skills and learned a
            collection of helpful technologies to further propel my computer
            science career.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Hello there! Welcome to my report on my second stint at Manulife.
            This time around, I was doing data engineering with Databricks and
            Python. I'd like to share with you my overall experience at Manulife
            this summer and what I took away from this work term.
          </p>
          <h3>Information about the employer</h3>
          <p>
            Manulife is a large Canadian-based, multinational insurance and
            financial services company. They've been around quite a while, since
            1887 to be precise. Clearly, they've had a lot of time to accrue a
            massive pile of data. For decades, Manulife has been storing most of
            it's abundance of data in it's on-premises mainframe system. While
            they do still work, these mainframe systems are very much out of
            date and often very painful to work with. Manulife has been working
            on moving away from these mainframe systems to much more modern
            cloud-based systems which are easier to work with and scale better.
            This is where my role comes in, I was helping with the extraction,
            transformation and loading (ETL) of mainframe data to the cloud.
          </p>
          <h3>Job Description</h3>
          <p>
            As I mentioned above, I was doing data engineering during this
            work-term. More specifically, I was working with the Hopper squad to
            help to build the process that would eventually be responsible for
            automatically moving all data from the mainframe to the cloud.
            Assisting with the creation of this automation process was, of
            course, not as simple as it sounds. While reading data from the
            mainframe was thankfully abstracted away, and writing data to the
            output cloud database tables was very simple, the middle step of
            applying transformations to the mainframe data to satisfy business
            requirements proved to be a tricky task. To do this transformation
            work, the squad introduced me to Apache Spark, a data processing
            framework. This framework was very useful in that it could apply
            complex logic to a dataset in a way that was easy to understand.
            Most of my time during this work-term was spent debugging,
            improving, and creating new transformation jobs using Apache Spark
            on the Databricks platform, a cloud runtime for Spark.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also spent a lot of time writing unit tests for these
            transformations. It was critical to ensure these transformations did
            what we expected them to do, for every possible case, so writing
            exhaustive tests was a very important part of the job, even if it
            wasn't the most exciting.
          </p>
          <p>
            While not a part of my official job as a data engineer, I also did
            some work to improve the squad's development environment. One such
            improvement I undertook was creating and documenting a new testing
            environment in an attempt to increase the runtime performance of the
            tests. Running the Spark unit tests on Windows machines was horribly
            slow due to Spark not being optimized for Windows. Some tests could
            take upwards of an hour to run, while only taking minutes on
            Unix-like machines. Unsatisfied with this, I leveraged the Windows
            Subsystem for Linux (WSL) to create a Linux environment to run our
            tests in. This resulted in a massive performance improvement for the
            tests, in some cases they ran up to 60 times faster. I also
            undertook smaller improvements, like fixing database connections for
            a specific Spark cluster type. While programming the transformations
            was my main duty, I'm happy to use my technical intuition help iron
            out the small annoyances.
          </p>
          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            I set three goals for myself to work towards during my term at
            Manulife this past summer.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first of the three goals was to learn about and experience the
            field of data science/data engineering. I had never done any data
            engineering work previously, so I wanted to know more about it, like
            what problems it solves and what tools are commonly used. After
            working in the field for the summer, I gained some understanding of
            data engineering and the problems it solves, but also realized I am
            nowhere near grasping the whole field. It is a very broad
            discipline. What I did gain was an understanding of how data
            engineering solves the problems presented by Manulife, and why the
            tools we used to solve the problems were used. For example, building
            ETL pipelines to relocate and transform data is a data engineering
            task, and we use Apache Spark along with Databricks and Python to
            build the pipelines because of their flexibility and ease of
            manipulating large sets of data.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second goal was to improve my demonstration and presentation
            skills. When creating this goal, I felt like I was not able to
            demonstrate functionality as clear as I should be able to. Over the
            course of the Summer, I was given multiple opportunities to gives
            demos on things I had worked on/created. Through these
            opportunities, I became more confident and became better at
            structuring how I present information. I found a big help in this
            was planning the structure of my presentations, rather than planning
            what I would say. Sticking to a script is difficult, it's much
            easier to have an idea of what I need to talk about and simply talk
            about. After all, when presenting my own work, I'm the expert.
            Another big help in working towards this goal was feedback from
            teammates. I was able to guage how well I explained myself based on
            feedback from squad members, and paying attention to common question
            topics from the audience.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final goal was simply to see if I enjoy data engineering work. I
            am trying to experience something new each co-op term, so I can find
            the kind of work I like and the kind of work I don't. Doing data
            engineering was interesting, and I liked it more than I thought I
            would. Python is a great language to use, and databricks is a cool
            platform. Apache Spark is a very powerful tool and I'm happy I got
            the chance to use it in a real project. With that being said, I
            think I prefer backend web development. I feel at home writing
            backend code, but I'm glad I had this experience so I know what data
            engineering is like. If I get bored of backend development in the
            future, I wouldn't be opposed to coming back to this kind of work.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            My summer of data engineering Manulife was a great experience.
            Hopper squad was an awesome squad to be a member of. I learned a lot
            about a very different field of computer science, and got to gain
            experience with a bunch of cool technologies that I hope to use
            again one day. While data engineering may not be my first field of
            choice, I will not forget what I learned this summer and hope I will
            be able to apply this knowledge in my future career!

            true for me. Back when it was application season for my first ever
            co-op work term, I remember viewing Shopify as a halo company. A
            place I applied to every chance I could no matter how slim the odds
            of an offer seemed. I wanted it so bad, and I thought maybe with
            some luck eventually I could get it. I'm proud to report that
            eventually I did get it!
          </p>

            I joined Shopify in January 2022 and was placed on the
            infrastructure security team, the team responsible for securing the
            Google Cloud Platform based resources Shopify runs on. Initially I
            was anxious about joining this team; I had no experience dealing
            with cloud native infrastructure, nevermind securing it. The team
            primarily worked in Go, a language that I had previously only
            experimented with. Thankfully, with the help of my great mentor and
            ultra-supportive team, I was able to overcome these challenges and
            have a fun and productive eight months with the team.

            Shopify's history starts in 2006, when now company CEO Tobias Lütke
            wanted to open an online store called Snowdevil to sell snowboarding
            equipment online. Tobias wasn't satisfied with existing e-commerce
            solutions, so he decided to build his own. Leveraging the hot
            framework at the time,
            <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a>, Lütke built
            the first iteration of Shopify. To this day Shopify's core still
            runs entirely on Rails.
          </p>
          <p>
            Shopify is now a remote-first company, Digital by design in
            Shopify's own words. This means Shopify employees are allowed to
            work wherever they want in their country of residence, with
            restrictions only coming from legal requirements. This was not
            always the case. Before the pandemic in 2020 a Shopify employee
            would work out of one of many worldwide offices. During the pandemic
            while everyone was remote, many Shopify employees began to fancy the
            remote experience, so leadership decided to make remote work
            permanent. Shopify sold some offices, and converted the rest into
            "Ports", offices that can be booked out by teams for in-person
            working.
          </p>
          <h3>Job Description</h3>
          <p>
            I joined Shopify as an infrastructure security intern on the
            infrastructure security team. This team is a branch of production
            engineering where, as I mentioned above, the goal is to keep
            Shopify's
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Google Cloud Platform (GCP)</a>
            resources as secure as possible, ensuring Shopify isn't an easy
            target for internet hackers and opportunists. Shopify is a very
            large Google
            <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine"
              >Kubernetes engine
            </a>
            customer, with hundreds if not thousands of clusters each containing
            many individual compute nodes. It's a unique challenge to ensure
            each cluster's nodes and supporting services are properly set up to
            ensure security, while not negatively affecting the productivity of
            developers at Shopify.
          </p>
          <p>
            My time on the infrastructure security team was extremely
            interesting and challenging. One of the most interesting/challenging
            things to wrap my head around was working with
            <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> at such a massive
            scale. Kubernetes is an open-source, Google-created system for
            managing the deployment and lifecycle of containerized software. It
            automates much of the container deployment and management process,
            allowing organizations to operate at global scale without the pain
            of traditional deployment strategies. Kubernetes is an incredibly
            complicated software system; it took me months to understand basics
            of how it functions and the advantages it provides. Now that I've
            been exposed to Kubernetes for eight months, I am much more
            comfortable around it and see the immense value such a system
            brings. Kubernetes provides features for applying security rules to
            all nodes in a cluster like role-based access control (RBAC),
            admission controllers, and ingress objects that allow infrastructure
            security's job to be realistically manageable rather than an
            insurmountable amount of manual work. This exposure to Kubernetes
            and it's plethora of powerful features allowed me to build
            foundational knowledge of how infrastructure is kept secure in a
            modern, global scale setting.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another super interesting thing I found was the kind of security
            problems the team was working on solving. Shopify is already an
            incredibly secure platform. All of the glaring and simple security
            problems I was aware of when I started had already been mitigated,
            likely many years ago. For the most part, the problems the team was
            working on were problems that I would never have even thought of, or
            never would have thought needed to be addressed. I'm talking about
            problems that are very specific, and assume already in-place and
            battle-tested solutions fail for some reason. An arbitrary example
            of one such problem could be "Let's say a malicious actor wants to
            exfil the environment variables of a Kubernetes cluster node. They
            somehow get write to access our container registry and push a
            malicious image and attempt to deploy it to a cluster. The cluster's
            admission controller will see that the image was from our container
            registry, and allow the image to be run on a node in the cluster,
            allowing for potentially sensitive environment variables to be
            leaked." This problem assumes a lot of things have gone wrong. It
            assumes there's a user that is somehow able to write to Shopify's
            container registry, and is able to create Kubernetes objects, two
            permissions which are tracked and not handed out like candy. It also
            assumes that the target cluster is misconfigured to allow access to
            node level environment variables from the containers running on it.
            Above all else, it assumes the attacker knows exactly how Shopify's
            Kubernetes implementation is structured and how to get around all
            the security rules. While this isn't a real example, this is exactly
            the kind of problems my team works on solving; assuming everything
            goes wrong and existing protections are bypassed, where are we most
            vulnerable? When presenting a problem like this, members of the team
            would often use the term "Putting on my tinfoil hat for a second,
            imagine a scenario where...". This expression shows just how out
            there and unlikely these security problems can seem, but if someone
            actually pulls one off, the results could be catestrophic. Let's say
            someone actually gets into the situation where they are able to
            perform the above example attack. A Kubernetes node may contain very
            sensitive information like API keys, which can open the door for an
            attacker to do very bad things like access resources such as
            customer/merchant data or mine dogecoin on Shopify's clusters.
          </p>
          <p>
            The team worked primarily in <a href="https://go.dev/">Go</a>, a
            language I didn't have any real prior experience with. To maximize
            my impact on the team, I needed to get good with Go. I was able to
            get comfortable with the syntax of Go within the first few weeks out
            of onboarding, and started reading about common design patterns and
            best practices not long after. After finishing the term, I can
            confidently say I am able to write quality code and logically
            structure an application in Go. The skills that helped me most were
            being open to critism, and not being afraid to make mistakes. During
            code reviews, being open to critism and asking questions about how
            to improve my code allowed me to super-charge my learning of Go.
            Also due to code reviews, I was able to make mistakes and have them
            be caught by the team, allowing me to explore different
            solutions/approaches to problems and further accelerating my growth
            as a Go developer.

          <h3>Goals</h3>
          <p>
            Since I was at Shopify for both W22 and S22 terms, I will focus on
            my three goals from the more recent Summer term.
          </p>
          <p>
            My first goal was to ship (finish and deploy) Hatchery v2 which was
            a project I had been working on mostly independently. When I wrote
            this goal just after the midpoint of my co-op, I had been working on
            this project for about two months. Hatchery v2 was an overhaul of an
            internal piece of software called Hatchery. Hatchery had some issues
            that made it hard for the team to work with/maintain it, and hard
            for new users to pick up and use. I really wanted to finish this
            project before I left as it made major improvements to Hatchery for
            both us and it's users. I also prioritized this project because it
            was a great source of learning for me. I was able to explore new
            technolgies working on this project, such as
            <a href="https://www.packer.io/">Hashicorp Packer</a> and
            <a href="https://buildkite.com/">Buildkite</a> and gain experience
            with some powerful Go libraries like
            <a href="https://github.com/urfave/cli">urfave/cli</a> and the
            <a href="https://github.com/googleapis/google-cloud-go"
              >GCP Go SDK</a
            >. The things I learned from this project and the
            design->feedback->redesign process loop I went through made me a
            much stronger Go developer and software engineer in general. From
            completing this project I found that Go to be a very enjoyable
            language to use, and that I would love to build my career around
            being a Go developer. I was successful in completing this goal, I
            shipped Hatchery v2 in July 2022 and have had multiple people use
            the new system and give positive feedback.
          </p>
          <p>
            My second goal was to give an infrasec talk (brief, informal
            presentation to team) informing the team on my work on Hatchery v2
            and what they need to know about the upcoming changes. I've always
            felt weak in general at giving presentations, so I've been trying to
            do it as much as possible to improve in this area. I thought this
            would be a great opportunity to give a presentation as the audience
            is people I'm comfortable with and it's a topic I'm very familiar
            with. I knew this presentation needed to be strong, as I had limited
            time remaining on the team. I had to ensure Hatchery v2's usage and
            changes were made crystal clear to the team so they wouldn't have
            any questions left unanswered after I left. I gave the Hatchery v2
            presentation in late August, and I believe it went well. I was able
            to explain how Hatchery v2 works differently than the original
            implementation, and answer all questions the team had. I have had
            members of the team successfully using Hatchery v2 without requiring
            assistance which indicates I was able to convey the required
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            My final goal for my Summer at Shopify was continuing to improve my
            Go skills, specifically in testing tools/techniques. Testing was an
            area that I was not comfortable in as I hadn't had the opportunity
            to write many tests. To make progress towards this goal, I committed
            to writing tests for Hatchery v2 and other projects I was
            contributing to. While I did learn a few things about testing with
            Go, I wouldn't say I was overly successful in achieving this goal. I
            did write tests for Hatchery v2 and other projects, but I didn't
            learn as much about testing as I would've liked. I stuck to pretty
            basic testing and tools when I probably should've dove deeper into
            the subject to learn more advanced and specific ways of testing Go
            applications. For example, I didn't make use of Go's
            <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/httptest">httptest</a> package
            or look into any dedicated testing packages other than the widely
            used
            <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">stretchr/testify</a>.
          </p>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            Overall, I had a great time at Shopify. I'm very grateful for the
            opportunity to try out another subset of software engineering, cloud
            infrastructure security. Using Go to build software to secure
            Kubernetes and other cloud resources has been a fresh and
            constructive experience. I enjoyed the experience so much that I
            decided to re-join the infrastructure security team after I
            graduate. I'm looking forward to getting back and securing some
            infrastructure! 🔒

          <h3>Acknowledgments</h3>
          <p>
            Shoutout to the infrastructure security team! It was a pleasure to
            be on the team! Everyone was super friendly and helpful. The team is
            filled with insanely smart, driven, and generally fantastic
            individuals. The passion and friendliness team made my co-op
            experience one I will never forget. Super excited to be going back
            after I'm graduated!
